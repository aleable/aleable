### Hello!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.seresearch.qmul.ac.uk/ccs/">Centre for Complex Systems</a>, within the <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/">School of Mathematical Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/">Queen Mary University of London</a>, where I work with <a href="https://webspace.maths.qmul.ac.uk/c.beck/">Christian Beck</a>. Previously, I completed my PhD at the <a href="https://is.mpg.de/">Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://cdebacco.com/">Caterina De Bacco</a> and supported by the <a href="https://imprs.is.mpg.de">International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems</a>. After my PhD, I also interned at <a href="https://ai.sony/">Sony AI</a>. I earned my Master's in Mathematical Engineering and my my Bachelor's in Physics at the <a href="https://www.unipd.it/en/">University of Padova</a>.
