### Welcome to my GitHub profile ðŸŽ‰

I am Alessandro Lonardi, a Ph.D. Student at <a href="https://www.is.mpg.de/">Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems</a> (TÃ¼bingen, Germany), working under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://cdebacco.com/">Caterina De Bacco</a> in the <a href="https://www.is.mpg.de/employees?_=1598796063852&action=index&controller=employees&departments=pio&query=&utf8=\%E2\%9C\%93">Physics for Inference and Optimization</a> group. The main focus of my current research is studying routing problems combining approaches stemming from optimal transport, statistical physics, and belief propagation. In particular, I am interested in understanding how different route selection mechanisms affect traffic and total path length of networks. The applications of my work span from urban to biological networks. Previously I was a Master's Student in Mathematical Engineering at <a href="https://www.unipd.it/en/">UniPd</a> (Padua, Italy), where I also obtained my Bachelor's degree in Physics.
