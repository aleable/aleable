### Hello! ðŸ™ƒ

I am a researcher in complex systems and machine learning. Recently, I interned at <a href="https://ai.sony//">Sony AI</a> in Barcelona, Spain. Before that, I did my PhD at the <a href="https://www.is.mpg.de/">Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems</a> in TÃ¼bingen, Germany, under the supervision of <a href="https://cdebacco.com/">Caterina De Bacco</a>.

More about me can be found on my website: <a href="https://aleable.github.io/">aleable.github.io</a>.

If you would like to get in touch with me, please send an email to: <a href="alessandro.lonardi.vr@gmail.com">alessandro.lonardi.vr@gmail.com</a>.

My profile picture is taken from a fantastic videogame called [Gris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gris).
